These are my custom keymaps for vim.

rus.vim

The following abbreviation in .vimrc

abb rru set keymap=rus

Russian phonetic layout different from the standart. The difference is the same as for standart Ubuntu Russian Phonetic and Phonetic Winkeys.
This layout was popularized by Paul Gorodyansky

The differences are well shown in /usr/share/X11/xkb/symbols/ru (Ubuntu keys layout file)

    key	<LatX> {	[     Cyrillic_ha,     Cyrillic_HA	]	};
    key	<LatH> {	[     Cyrillic_che,     Cyrillic_CHE	]	};
    key	<AE12> {	[ Cyrillic_softsign, Cyrillic_softsign  ]	};

Also some details of another keymap script are used (toggling layouts by F8 and cursor color change).
